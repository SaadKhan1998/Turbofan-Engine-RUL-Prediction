# Turbofan-Engine-RUL-Prediction using Transformers

# Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines using a Transformer-based deep learning model. The CMAPSS dataset is used for training and evaluation, and the workflow involves data preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning with Optuna.

# Features
Data Loading & Preprocessing: Efficient handling of CMAPSS dataset, including feature engineering and normalization.
Transformer-based Model: A deep learning model utilizing self-attention mechanisms for sequence prediction.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Uses Optuna to optimize key model parameters.
Training & Evaluation: Monitors loss curves and evaluates performance using metrics like RMSE.
Results Visualization: Graphical analysis of training loss and validation loss for different configurations.
