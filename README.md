# Turbofan-Engine-RUL-Prediction
This repository implements a Transformer-based model for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction using the CMAPSS dataset. It includes data preprocessing, training, hyperparameter tuning with Optuna, and result visualization. The code is modular, covering data loading, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
